ARRAYArrayLinearca structure representing a fixed length ordered collection of values or objects with the same type BINARY SEARCH TREE Tree
Non-LinearôA binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where the key in each node is greater than all keys in the left subtree and less than all keys in the right subtree, enabling efficient search, insertion, and deletion. GRAPH Graphs
Non-LinearêA graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes, representing relationships between entities. Graphs can be directed or undirected and are used to model complex relationships in various applications. HASH TABLE Hash
Non-LinearûA hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, where data elements are stored in an array using a hash function to map keys to their corresponding values, enabling efficient retrieval and storage operations. HEAPTree
Non-LinearÁA heap is a complete binary tree-based data structure where each node satisfies the heap property, which could be either a max-heap or a min-heap, used for efficient priority queue operations. LINKED LIST ListLinearÈA linked list is a linear collection of elements, where each element (node) contains a reference to the next node in the sequence, enabling dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion. LIST List Linear¸A list is a collection of elements where each element points to the next, forming a linear sequence of nodes. Lists allow dynamic resizing and efficient insertion/deletion operations. QUEUE AbstractLinear»A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front, resembling a real-life queue. SELF-BALANCE TREE Tree
Non-Linear¿A self-balancing tree is a hierarchical data structure where the balance of the tree is maintained automatically during insertions and deletions to ensure optimal search and retrieval times. SET	Abstract LinearÚA set is a collection of distinct elements with no specific order, where each element is unique. Sets are used to represent mathematical concepts and perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. STACKAbstract
Non-Linear¬A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are inserted and removed from the top, resembling a stack of plates. TWO DIMENSION ARRAY ArrayLinear7consists of single-dimensional arrays as its elements.
